# Rules for locating and extracting HTML elements from VLR.gg match scoreboards.

1. ALWAYS reference the user ("Quinn") if you're unsure which selector or approach to use.
2. Use CSS selectors, not regex, to find data elements.
   - Event page: `.wf-card` to find match cards.
   - Match list tab: `.wf-table .match-row a` for match links.
   - Scoreboard page: 
     • `.vm-stats__layout table` for per-map stats tables.
     • Inside each table, header row is <tr> with <th> names; data rows are <tr> with <td>.
3. Extract columns in this exact order (matching our schema):  
   bracket_stage, match_datetime, patch, team1_name, team1_score, team2_name, team2_score, event_id, event_name, match_id, map_name, player_name, player_team, player_country, agent_played, rounds_played, rating_2_0, game_score, ACS, KDRatio, KAST_pct, ADR, KPR, APR, FKPR, FDPR, HS_pct, CL_pct, CL_count, max_kills_in_round, total_kills, total_deaths, total_assists, total_first_kills, total_first_deaths
4. If any selector fails, log an ERROR and skip the row—but DO NOT crash.  
5. Enforce a 1–2 second delay between HTTP requests to avoid rate-limiting.
