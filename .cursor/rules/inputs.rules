# Rules for reading and validating your config/events.yaml (or JSON).

1. ALWAYS check with the user (Quinn) if a key or format is ambiguous.
2. Expect a YAML file at `config/events.yaml` with this structure:
   events:
     - event_id: <integer or string>
       event_name: <string>
       match_urls:    # optional—either this or match_ids
         - https://vlr.gg/match/<match_id>/scoreboard
       match_ids:     # optional—either this or match_urls
         - <match_id>
3. event_id and event_name are REQUIRED for each entry.
4. match_urls or match_ids is REQUIRED; if both are present, prioritize match_urls.
5. Validate types:
   - event_id: non-empty string or integer
   - event_name: non-empty string
   - match_urls: list of valid URLs matching `^https://www\.vlr\.gg/match/\d+/.*$`
   - match_ids: list of digits
6. On parsing errors, alert the user (Quinn) with details about which entry failed.
