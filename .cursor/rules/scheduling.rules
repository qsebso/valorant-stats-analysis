# scheduling.rules
# How to tag each match as “Regular Season” vs “Playoffs” and where to store that mapping.

1. ALWAYS refer to Quinn if date ranges or bracket naming is unclear.
2. Maintain a lookup file: `config/phases.yaml`:
   phases:
     - match_id: <match_id>
       phase: "Regular Season"
     - match_id: <match_id>
       phase: "Playoffs – Upper Semis"
   # Alternatively, allow date-based rules:
   rules:
     - from: 2025-01-10
       to:   2025-01-20
       phase: "Regular Season"
     - from: 2025-01-21
       to:   2025-01-25
       phase: "Playoffs"
3. scheduler.py should:
   a. Load `phases.yaml`.
   b. If a match_id exists in the lookup, use that phase.
   c. Else, check date-based rules.
   d. If still no match, log WARNING and default phase to “Unknown”—then ask Quinn.
